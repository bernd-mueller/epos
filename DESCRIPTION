Title: Epilepsy Ontology Similarities
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Bernd Mueller
Maintainer: Bernd Mueller <bernd.mueller@zbmed.de>
Depends: R (>= 2.10)
Description: Analysis and visualization of similarities between epilepsy ontologies based on text minin results by comparin ranked lists of co-occurring drug terms in the corpus of LIVIVO. The ranked result lists of neurological drug terms co-occurring with named entities from the epilepsy ontologies EpSO, ESSO, and EPILONT are aggregated in order to generate three different results: an overview table of drugs that are relevant to epilepsy created with the method createNeuroTable, a venn diagram visualizing the complements and intersection of the drug terms associated to the epilepsy ontoloies create with the method drawVennPlot (), and plot of tanimoto similarity coefficients between the aggregated list of drug terms against the list of drug terms from each of the ontologies created with the method createTanimotoBaseline(). The alignment of the Top-K Ranked Lists is conducted using the R-package TopKLists <https://cran.r-project.org/package=TopKLists>. The source data to create the ranked lists of drug names is produced using the text mining workflows described in Mueller, Bernd and Hagelstein, Alexandra (2016) <doi:10.4126/FRL01-006408558> and Mueller, Bernd et al. (2017) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-58694-6_22>.
